R code to reproduce the Motivating Example and Simulation Study detailed in 'Bayesian sample size determination using robust commensurate priors with interpretable discrepancy weights'.

The file 'MotivatingExample.R' is for reproducing the results presented in the Motivating Example (Section 4) using the proposed Bayesian sample size formula and linearization technique.

The file 'SS_simulationstudy.R' is for calculating the sample sizes used in the Performance Evaluation (Section 5) for Configurations 1-4 of historical data.

The file 'Analysis_simulationstudy.R' is for simulating clinical trial datasets with sample sizes according to 'SS_simulationstudy.R' and implementing the subsequent Bayesian analysis.
